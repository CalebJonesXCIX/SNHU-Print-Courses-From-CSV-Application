# SNHU-Print-Courses-From-CSV-Application

### Included in this repository are all the necessary components to deploy the project to Visual Studio:
- ABCU_CourseList_Displayer.cpp
  - This is the main C++ application for the described theoretical situation. 
- ABCU_Advising_Program_Input.csv
  - This is the CSV document that contains the unsorted course information
- Pseudocode and Runtime Analysis.docx
  - This is the primary documentation that contains pseudocode for the potential data structures as well as runtime analysis of the Big O for each possible solution

The following is an application that was coded as a project for Southern New Hampshire University. It receives an input of a CSV containing an unsorted list of computer science courses that also contain prerequisites. The program then builds the CSV into a data structure using C++. Then the course information is built into an object and sorted. It can be printed and searched through according to the desires of the user through a menu interface.

The problem that was being solved through the projects of this course was the underlying use cases of the various abstract data structures in C++. My approach to this was to begin to understand what all the data structures are, how to build them and what they are used for. This is important to understand if you want to optimize your code's functionality by using an optimal data structure for the situation at hand. A common roadblock was building the structures from scratch. Prior knowledge to this course was heavily Java focused therefore I had a conceptual understanding of each data structure and used this to build it out in C++ from there. The work on this project has expanded my knowledge in overall software design. There is an emphasis on modular development and this has been proven to be one of the more successful ways to develop an application. This means that my mentality has evolved from creating a monolithic application to something that is smaller, simpler and well commented and documented. As a result code developed this way is easier to maintain and adapt with overtime.
